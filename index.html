    <p id="my-bio" class="left-margin">
      While I currently reside in Orlando, I was born and raised on the east
      coast of Florida. Growing up, I had a dual fascination with both the arts
      and various scientific disciplines. Cultivating a diverse range of
      knowledge, I've studied technology, biological sciences, business, and the
      fine arts throughout my academic career. I have a passion for both the
      design and technical aspects of web and mobile apps, with a focus on
      creating fun and interesting visuals. I'm excited to share these passions
      with others in my future work and career.

            In this app, users are presented with a series of three questions.

          One problem I had while making this was that one of the questions had
          an answer already selected by default, which wasn't what I was
          intending. To fix this, I used "null" instead of "0" as that
          question's "useState()" value.

          While making this, I couldn't correctly implement the Suggested

          suggested exercises as route params in the DurationExercise and
          RepetitonExercise functions and then used them in their respective
          navigation.navigate methods.

          During the creation process, I noticed that checking or unchecking a
          box would cause the whole list to disappear. I figured out that it was
          because I didn't add a rest parameter into the setTasks method in the
          update Task function.

          Since I was very new to React when working on this, I missed putting
          in many important curly braces. These are there so that values don't
          have to be hardcoded and you can pass in JavaScript variables and
          objects containing whatever values you want.

                FlashDeck would be beneficial to people who need to study and
                like to stay organized. The app would allow users to create
                decks of flashcards and flip through the cards to study them.
                Features would include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>creating, editing, and deleting cards and decks</li>
                <li>studying the cards in sequence or shuffling them</li>
                <li>color coding and titling decks</li>

                  editable front and back of cards to separate prompt/question
                  from answer
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="card-text">The color scheme gives the app a lighter and less daunting look, which is done to ease the user's possible stress surrounding studying. Orange is used as an accent color because it tends to represent confidence and optimism, both feelings that this app hopes to invoke.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Button shapes closely resemble ones used in other apps for familiarity's sake. Shuffling the cards makes the answers harder to predict. Color coding the decks helps users distinguish them better and gives the app a more fun feel.</p>
